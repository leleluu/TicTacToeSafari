# Tic Tac Toe Safari 🦁

**Overview** 🗺

This is your classic tic tac toe game with a playful twist! 🐶 Start each game with a randomly generated pair of animal emojis and take part in an epic battle of tic tac toe. 

I created this app to deep dive into the principles of the **MVVM** architecture and show how even a simple app like tic tac toe can benefit from it. I've also included **unit tests** to showcase one of the main benefits of separating logic from the UI layer 😃.
